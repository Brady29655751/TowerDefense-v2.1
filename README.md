# TowerDefense-v2.1
I2P(II) Mini Project 2

Here provides a tower defense game. This game is completed with the help of ALLEGRO 5 and Visual Studio.

Therefore, you can just download TowerDefense.sln if you have installed Visual Studio.

Note that this is a very simple game, and also, this is the first time I try to create a game and use Git (or Github? Whatever.)

So, don't be shocked. No matter what you have seen.
